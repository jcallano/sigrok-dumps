Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a Lcsoft CY7C68013A Mini Board clone of the Saleae Logic.

  Channel       DS2432 pin
  ------------------------
   D0        Data line

Pulseview was used to capture the trace with the following parameters:

  - sample rate: 24 MHz
  - samples: 50 M
  

pjdlv41.sr
---------

Device 1 has bus address 44 and Device 2 has bus address 45.

The device 1 send the byte "B" to device 2.
The device 2 receive the data, and check for the "B" payload, blink a led and then respond sending a message with the same "B" Payload to device 1.

The speed mode used is mode 1
