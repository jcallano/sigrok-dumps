Pjon Padded Jittering Data Link PJDL V4.1 (SOFTWAREBITBANG - SWBB)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the capture of the traffic between two stm32f103c (blue pill) programmed using the library of Pjon available on Platformio.io using arduino framework under the example of Pjon/ARDUINO/Local/SoftwareBitBang/SendAndRecive/device1 and device2.

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a No name LHT00SU1: It is a clone of the CWAV USBee AX-Pro
captured with analog channel 0 and converted to logical levels to avoid spurious spikes appearing on digital channels.

  Channel       DS2432 pin
  ------------------------
   A0        Data line

Pulseview was used to capture the trace with the following parameters:

  - sample rate: 4 MHz
  - samples: 2 M
  

pjdllht.sr
---------

Device 1 has bus address 44 and Device 2 has bus address 45.

The device 1 send the byte "B" to device 2.
The device 2 receive the data, and check for the "B" payload, blink a led and then respond sending a message with the same "B" Payload to device 1.
The speed mode used is mode 1:
MODE	Data bit duration	Padding bit duration	Pad-data ratio	Bandwidth	Range
1	   44	     		  	116		 2.636	1.95kB/s - 15625Bd	2000m

The protocol is software implemented in the micro controller and the micro controller need to listen actively to be able to catch the communication. In this example the time set for communication listening is 500ms.

We can see 3 types of data frames in this dump, isolated in the following files:

decoder.sr
Timing and markers set to manual decode the frame. In file decode1.jpg you can se the Data frame Components.
Device 45 is sending "B" to Device 44 with the configuration header with AKC bit set and Tx ID bit set

dataframe2.sr
Raw data of Device 44is sending "B" to Device 45 with the configuration header with AKC bit set and Tx ID bit set

failedack.sr

In this Data frame we can evidence the lack of ack of the receiving device. In this case after a preconfigured waiting time the message is re-schedule for sending. This happens in this example probably because in that moment the receiving device was not listening when communication was started.
